# simd_html
Fast streaming HTML parser using SIMDe for token classification

In an not-quite-scientific benchmark, vectorized SIMD token classification on an Apple x86 laptop reading 1GB of Wikipedia HTML (just over 2% of characters are matches in `{'<', '&', '\r', '\0'}`), this AVX2 SIMD implementation is over *10x faster* than the naive method (scanning through the string one character at a time, even when checking by most frequent to least frequent and compiling with `-O3` which would trigger auto-vectorization, which might be sufficient in the case of a single matched character but not for matching multiple characters).
